# Webpack + tailwind base setup
**Work in progress**.

Starting out with no framework and getting to know how to setup Webpack 5 with the easiest website building package I can come up with.

## Dependencies
```
npm install -D webpack webpack-cli html-webpack-plugin webpack-dev-server
```

The cleanup plugin is apparently no longer required, there's now an option to clean the output directory. The dev server is also started slightly differently.
